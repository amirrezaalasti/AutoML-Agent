[2025-06-05 11:44:27] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'MNIST (Keras)'}] You are a data science expert with deep knowledge of image datasets. Your task is to generate clear, structured, and comprehensive instructions for effectively working with the dataset 'MNIST (Keras)'. Dataset description: This is an image dataset.

Number of classes: 10
Class distribution:
1    6742

Name: count, dtype: int64

Image Data Handling Requirements:
1. Input Format Requirements:
   - For CNN models: Input must be in (batch, channels, height, width) format
   - For dense/linear layers: Input should be flattened

2. Data Processing Steps:
   a) For flattened input (2D):
      - Calculate dimensions: height = width = int(sqrt(n_features))
      - Verify square dimensions: height * height == n_features
      - Reshape to (N, 1, H, W) for CNNs
   b) For 3D input (N, H, W):
      - Add channel dimension: reshape to (N, 1, H, W)
   c) For 4D input:
      - Verify channel order matches framework requirements

3. Framework-Specific Format:
   - PyTorch: (N, C, H, W)
   - TensorFlow: (N, H, W, C)
   - Convert between formats if necessary

4. Normalization:
   - Scale pixel values to [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0
   - Or standardize to mean=0, std=1


Please perform the following tasks:
1. Describe the recommended data preprocessing steps specific to this dataset.
2. Outline useful feature engineering strategies relevant to the dataset's type and domain.
3. Mention any common challenges or important considerations when working with this dataset type.
4. If this dataset exists on OpenML:
   - Provide the exact dataset name as listed on OpenML.
   - Include the dataset's tag(s) on OpenML.
   - Provide the direct OpenML URL to the dataset.

Return all the above in a structured JSON format matching the following fields:
- dataset_name (str)
- dataset_tag (str)
- dataset_instructions (list of str)
