Reshape the input data to the appropriate format. If using CNNs, reshape to (N, 1, H, W) where H and W are the height and width of the images, and N is the number of samples. If using dense layers, flatten the images into a 1D array.\n2. Normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing each pixel value by 255.0.\n3. If using a framework like TensorFlow, ensure the channel dimension is the last dimension (N, H, W, C). For PyTorch, ensure it's the second dimension (N, C, H, W). Transpose the dimensions as needed.\n\nUseful Feature Engineering Strategies:\n1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality while preserving important features.\n2. ZCA Whitening: Reduce redundancy in the input data.\n3. Image Augmentation: Create new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation.\n\nCommon Challenges and Considerations:\n1. Class Imbalance: The dataset has a slightly uneven class distribution. Consider using techniques like oversampling or class weighting to address this.\n2. Input Format: Ensure the input data is in the correct format for the chosen framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch).\n3. Normalization: Proper normalization is crucial for optimal model performance.\n4. Overfitting: MNIST is relatively simple; be mindful of overfitting, especially with complex models. Use regularization techniques (dropout, L1/L2 regularization).", 'The MNIST dataset is available on OpenML under the name "MNIST".', "The dataset's tag on OpenML is 'artificial'.", 'The OpenML URL for the MNIST dataset is https://www.openml.org/d/554'] openml_url='https://www.openml.org/d/554'
