Reshape the images to a suitable format for your chosen model (CNN or dense layer).\n2. Normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0.\n\nUseful feature engineering strategies relevant to the dataset's type and domain:\n1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.\n2. ZCA whitening to decorrelate features.\n3. Image augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations, translations, scaling) to increase the size and diversity of the training set.\n\nCommon challenges or important considerations when working with this dataset type:\n1. Overfitting, especially when using complex models.\n2. Ensuring proper data normalization and scaling.\n3. Choosing appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).\n4. Class imbalance may affect model performance.", 'If this dataset exists on OpenML:\n- Dataset name as listed on OpenML: MNIST\n- Dataset tag(s) on OpenML: classic, classification, image\n- Direct OpenML URL to the dataset: https://www.openml.org/search?q=MNIST'] openml_url='https://www.openml.org/search?q=MNIST'
