[2025-06-17 19:13:53] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': '20 Newsgroups'}] dataset_name='20 Newsgroups' dataset_tag='text classification' recommended_configuration='{"facade": "HyperparameterOptimizationFacade", "min_budget": 1, "max_budget": 9, "n_workers": 4}' scenario_plan="The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a medium-sized text classification dataset. Given the dataset's size (16182 entries) and average text length (1185.93 characters), hyperparameter optimization is appropriate. Multi-fidelity optimization might not be necessary given the dataset size. A BlackBoxFacade is suitable for optimizing hyperparameters without multi-fidelity. The number of workers (n_workers) should be set based on the available computational resources. Special considerations for this dataset include text preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, special character removal) and feature extraction (TF-IDF or word embeddings)." train_function_plan='The train function should accept a configuration (hyperparameter settings) and a seed. It should preprocess the text data, extract features, train a model (e.g., a neural network or a traditional ML model like SVM or Random Forest), and return a performance metric (e.g., accuracy or F1-score). The preprocessing steps should include tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of special characters. Feature extraction could involve TF-IDF or word embeddings. The model should be trained on the processed data, and the validation performance should be returned as a float value (SMAC minimizes the target function, so return 1 - accuracy if using accuracy).'
