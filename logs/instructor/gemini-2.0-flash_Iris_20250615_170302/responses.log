Instead, a BlackBoxFacade or HyperparameterOptimizationFacade is more appropriate. Given the dataset's simplicity, using a single worker (n_workers=1) is sufficient. For scenario parameters, define a configuration space relevant to the model's hyperparameters and set a reasonable walltime_limit (e.g., 60 seconds) and n_trials (e.g., 100) for the optimization process.
