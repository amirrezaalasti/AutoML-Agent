'] openml_url='https://www.openml.org/d/554' recommended_configuration="To effectively model this data, configure a Keras model with the following layers: a Reshape layer to transform the input to (28, 28, 1), convolutional layers (Conv2D) with 64 filters, a kernel size of (3, 3), ReLU activation, and 'same' padding, followed by MaxPooling2D layers with a pool size of (2, 2). Include BatchNormalization after the pooling layers. Continue with convolutional layers, increasing the number of filters to 128 and then 256, each followed by MaxPooling2D and BatchNormalization. After the convolutional blocks, flatten the output, add dense layers with 4096 units and ReLU activation, and include dropout layers with a rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting. Finally, add a dense output layer with softmax activation and units equal to the number of classes (10 for MNIST).Set the batch size to 128 and train the model for 5 epochs. This architecture mirrors the VGGNet style, with modifications tailored to the MNIST dataset."
