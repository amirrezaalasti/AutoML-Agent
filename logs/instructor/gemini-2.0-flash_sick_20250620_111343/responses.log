[2025-06-20 11:13:52] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'sick'}] dataset_name='sick' dataset_tag='tabular' recommended_configuration="The dataset 'sick' is a binary classification problem with a mix of categorical and numerical features. Preprocessing should include handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features. Feature engineering could involve creating interaction terms between relevant features or using domain knowledge to create new features. Common challenges include class imbalance and the presence of outliers. This dataset is available on OpenML under the name 'sick'. The tags include 'study_14', 'sick-euthyroid', 'SVC', 'thyroid-problems', 'cost-sensitive', 'binary-classification'. Based on the parameter suggestions, there are several configurations that could be explored. Considering the configurations provided, the dataset size, and the potential for long training times, a Multi-Fidelity approach might be beneficial if we can define a budget (e.g., subset of data, early stopping rounds). n_workers should be chosen based on the available resources. Since the dataset has a moderate number of samples, a smaller budget range might be sufficient. For example, using a subset of the data with min_budget=0.1 and max_budget=1, where 1 represents the full dataset. The scenario should be configured with walltime_limit, n_trials, and n_workers. Facade should be MultiFidelityFacade. The target function should handle the budget parameter (fraction of the dataset to use). Considering the limited TBG data, imputation might be required if this feature is deemed important." scenario_plan='1.  Define the Configuration Space: Create a configuration space with hyperparameters relevant to the chosen model (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength, number of trees, etc.). Use the ranges suggested by the provided configurations. For categorical features, consider one-hot encoding or other appropriate encoding methods.\n2.  Set up the Scenario: Define the scenario with a walltime limit (e.g., 3600 seconds), a number of trials (e.g., 100), and a number of workers based on available resources (e.g., 4). Configure the scenario for multi-fidelity optimization by setting min_budget and max_budget to appropriate values (e.g., 0.1 and 1.0). Do not set the name and output directory in the scenario. The Facade should be MultiFidelityFacade.\n' train_function_plan="1.  Load and preprocess the data: Load the 'sick' dataset and preprocess it according to the chosen strategy (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features).\n2.  Define the target function: Create a target function that takes a configuration, seed, and budget as input. Inside the target function, train a model with the given configuration on a subset of the data determined by the budget. Return the validation error of the trained model.\n3.  Optimize the model: Use SMAC's MultiFidelityFacade to optimize the model's hyperparameters. Pass the configuration space, scenario, and target function to the facade.\n"
