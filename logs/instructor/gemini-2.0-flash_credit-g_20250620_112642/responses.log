[2025-06-20 11:26:51] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'credit-g'}] dataset_name='credit-g' dataset_tag='credit scoring' recommended_configuration="The dataset 'credit-g' is a tabular dataset with a mix of categorical and numerical features, commonly used for credit scoring. Given its moderate size (800 samples, 20 features), the following steps are recommended:\n\n1.  Data Preprocessing:\n    *   Handle Categorical Features: Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding based on the feature's nature.\n    *   Scale Numerical Features: Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure they have a similar range of values.\n    *   Handle Missing Values: Check for and handle missing values, although the description doesn't mention any, it's good practice to check.\n    *   Address Class Imbalance: The label distribution shows an imbalance (559 good, 241 bad), so consider using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or cost-sensitive learning.\n\n2.  Feature Engineering:\n    *   Interaction Terms: Create interaction terms between relevant features (e.g., credit amount and duration).\n    *   Polynomial Features: Introduce polynomial features for numerical columns to capture non-linear relationships.\n    *   Domain-Specific Features: Create features based on domain knowledge. For example, derive a debt-to-income ratio if income data were available (or a proxy).\n\n3.  Common Challenges and Considerations:\n    *   Interpretability: Credit scoring models often require interpretability, so prefer simpler models or use explainable AI (XAI) techniques.\n    *   Regulatory Compliance: Be aware of fairness and non-discrimination regulations when building and deploying credit scoring models.\n    *   Data Quality: Ensure data accuracy and completeness, as errors can significantly impact model performance.\n\n4. OpenML:\n*   Dataset Name: credit-g\n*   Dataset Tags: credit scoring\n\nSMAC Configuration:\n\n1. Facade Type: HyperparameterOptimizationFacade.\n2. Budget Settings: Not applicable for this dataset as the number of samples is relatively small, Multi-Fidelity Optimization is not suggested.\n3. Number of Workers: n_workers=4 (adjust based on available CPU cores).\n4. Other Relevant Scenario Parameters: walltime_limit=300 (adjust based on the complexity of the target function).\n" scenario_plan='1.  Define the Configuration Space: Create a configuration space with hyperparameters for the chosen model (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength, number of layers, etc.).\n2.  Define the Scenario: Create a scenario with the configuration space, target function, and resource limits (e.g., walltime limit, number of trials).\n3.  Instantiate the Facade: Instantiate the HyperparameterOptimizationFacade with the scenario and target function.' train_function_plan='1.  Receive a Configuration: The train function should receive a configuration (hyperparameter settings) from SMAC.\n2.  Instantiate and Train the Model: Use the configuration to instantiate a machine learning model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, XGBoostClassifier) and train it on the training data.\n3.  Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the trained model on a validation set using an appropriate metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC).\n4.  Return the Performance: Return the validation performance to SMAC. Note: SMAC minimizes the returned value, so return 1 - accuracy or a similar transformation for metrics that should be maximized.'
