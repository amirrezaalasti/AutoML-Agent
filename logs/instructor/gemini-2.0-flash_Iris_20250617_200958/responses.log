[2025-06-17 20:10:06] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'Iris'}] dataset_name='Iris' dataset_tag='classification' recommended_configuration="For the Iris dataset, consider using a Random Forest model due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions. Optimize the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) and the maximum depth of the trees (max_depth). Specifically, explore n_estimators values from 50 to 200 with a step of 50, and max_depth values from 4 to 10 with a step of 2. Also, tune the minimum samples split (min_samples_split) from 2 to 10. A good starting point could be n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, and min_samples_split=2. For SMAC, given the dataset's small size and relatively quick training time, multi-fidelity optimization might not be the most beneficial. Therefore, use BlackBoxFacade for hyperparameter optimization. Set n_trials to 100 to allow sufficient exploration of the configuration space. Given the low computational cost, using 4 workers can speed up the optimization. Key scenario parameters include configspace, n_trials, and n_workers." scenario_plan='Given the dataset characteristics, multi-fidelity optimization might not be necessary. Use a BlackBoxFacade. Set n_trials to 100 and n_workers to 4. The scenario should include the configuration space, the number of trials (n_trials), and the number of workers (n_workers).' train_function_plan='The train function should take a configuration as input and return a performance metric (e.g., classification accuracy). The function will train a Random Forest model using the hyperparameters specified in the configuration. It should then evaluate the model on a validation set and return the validation accuracy. Make sure the target is transformed into numerical values. Also, handle potential exceptions and ensure consistent performance evaluation.'
