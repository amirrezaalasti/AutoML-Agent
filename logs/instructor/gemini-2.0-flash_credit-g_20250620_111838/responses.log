[2025-06-20 11:18:48] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'credit-g'}] dataset_name='credit-g' dataset_tag='classification' recommended_configuration="The dataset 'credit-g' is a classification problem with a mix of categorical and numerical features. Preprocessing should include handling categorical variables (one-hot encoding or similar), scaling numerical features, and addressing the class imbalance. Feature engineering could involve creating interaction terms between features or deriving new features from existing ones (e.g., credit amount per duration). Common challenges include dealing with the class imbalance and potential non-linear relationships between features. This dataset exists on OpenML under the name 'credit-g' and is tagged as 'classification'." scenario_plan='Scenario Plan:\n\n1.  **Multi-Fidelity Optimization:** Given the relatively small dataset size (800 samples) and the absence of information about expensive training, multi-fidelity optimization might not be the most beneficial approach. The overhead of managing budgets might outweigh the potential gains. However, if feature engineering or model training involves computationally intensive steps, exploring a subset of features or a reduced number of training iterations as a budget could be considered.\n\n2.  **Budget Settings:** If multi-fidelity optimization is used, the budget could represent a fraction of the training data (e.g., 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%) or the number of training epochs. A reasonable budget range could be min_budget=0.2 (20% of data or epochs) and max_budget=1.0 (100% of data or epochs).\n\n3.  **Number of Workers:** The number of workers (n_workers) should be set based on available computational resources (CPU cores). For a moderately sized dataset like this, a value between 2 and 4 workers could be appropriate, assuming a machine with at least that many cores.\n\n4.  **Special Considerations:**\n    *   **Class Imbalance:** The dataset exhibits class imbalance (559 good, 241 bad). SMAC should be configured to handle this, either through appropriate metrics (e.g., F1-score, AUC) or by using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting within the target function.\n    *   **Categorical Features:** The presence of categorical features necessitates careful handling during preprocessing (one-hot encoding, etc.). The configuration space should reflect the appropriate ranges and types for hyperparameters relevant to categorical feature handling within the model.\n    *   **Feature Interactions:** Exploring feature interactions might be beneficial, but this can increase the dimensionality of the search space. Consider using feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques in conjunction with SMAC.\n\nBased on these considerations, a BlackBoxFacade or HyperparameterOptimizationFacade might be more appropriate than a MultiFidelityFacade unless there are specific computationally intensive aspects of training that can be effectively budgeted.' train_function_plan="Train Function Plan:\n\n1.  **Input:** The train function should accept a configuration (hyperparameter settings) and a seed as input.\n2.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**\n    *   Load the 'credit-g' dataset.\n    *   Preprocess the data: handle categorical features (e.g., one-hot encode), scale numerical features (e.g., StandardScaler), and address class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE or class weighting).\n3.  **Model Training:**\n    *   Instantiate a classification model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, LogisticRegression) using the provided configuration.\n    *   Train the model on the preprocessed data.\n4.  **Evaluation:**\n    *   Evaluate the model's performance using an appropriate metric (e.g., F1-score, AUC, balanced accuracy) on a validation set.\n    *   Return the negative of the evaluation metric (since SMAC minimizes).\n5.  **Budget Handling (if using multi-fidelity):**\n    *   If a budget is provided, adjust the training process accordingly. For example, train on a subset of the data or for a limited number of epochs.\n6.  **Error Handling:**\n    *   Include error handling to catch potential exceptions during training and evaluation. Return a large value (e.g., 1.0) in case of errors to discourage SMAC from exploring similar configurations."
