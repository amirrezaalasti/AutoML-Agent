[2025-06-20 10:48:04] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'sick'}] dataset_name='sick' dataset_tag='tabular' recommended_configuration='The dataset \'sick\' is a tabular dataset with a mix of categorical and numerical features, and a class imbalance.  \n\n1.  Data Preprocessing:\n    *   Handle Missing Values: Impute missing values using appropriate strategies like mean/median for numerical features and mode for categorical features.\n    *   Encode Categorical Features: Convert categorical features into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n    *   Normalize Numerical Features: Scale numerical features to a standard range (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) to prevent features with larger values from dominating the model.\n    *   Address Class Imbalance: Employ techniques like oversampling the minority class (sick) or undersampling the majority class (negative) to balance the class distribution.\n\n2.  Feature Engineering:\n    *   Combine Features: Create new features by combining existing ones, such as creating interaction terms between thyroid-related features.\n    *   Domain-Specific Features: Incorporate domain knowledge to create features that capture relevant aspects of thyroid function, such as ratios of hormone levels.\n\n3.  Challenges and Considerations:\n    *   High Dimensionality: The dataset has a relatively large number of features, which can lead to overfitting. Use feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques.\n    *   Non-linearity: The relationships between features and the target variable may be non-linear, so consider using non-linear models or feature transformations.\n    *   Interpretability: Some models, like complex ensembles, can be difficult to interpret.  Consider using more interpretable models or techniques like SHAP or LIME to understand model predictions.\n\n4.  OpenML Information:\n    *   Dataset Name: sick\n    *   Dataset Tags: tabular\n\nConfiguration Space:\n\nFor SMAC, given the dataset size and the need to efficiently search the hyperparameter space, I would recommend the following:\n\n1.  Facade Type: HyperparameterOptimizationFacade (HPOFacade) - Since we want to optimize the hyperparameters of a classification model on this dataset.\n2.  Multi-fidelity Optimization: Given the dataset size (3017 samples) and the relatively low cost of training a model on it, multi-fidelity optimization may not be necessary.  However, if the training time for certain models is high, consider using MultiFidelityFacade.  In that case, set min_budget to a small subset of the data (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2 representing 10% or 20% of the data) and max_budget to 1.0 (representing the full dataset).\n3.  Number of Workers:  Set n_workers to the number of available CPU cores to parallelize the hyperparameter optimization process.\n4.  Scenario Parameters:\n    *   walltime_limit: Limit the optimization process by a time limit (e.g., 3600 seconds).\n    *   n_trials: Set the number of evaluated trials (e.g., 100).\n\nRecommended Configuration:\n\nAn example configuration with Random Forest:\n\n{\n    "n_estimators": (10, 200), "default": 100, "type": "int",\n    "max_features": (0.1, 1.0), "default": 0.5, "type": "float",\n    "min_samples_split": (2, 20), "default": 2, "type": "int",\n    "min_samples_leaf": (1, 10), "default": 1, "type": "int",\n    "n_workers": 4, # Set to the number of available CPU cores\n    "walltime_limit": 3600, # Limit the optimization process by a time limit\n    "n_trials": 100 # Set the number of evaluated trials\n}\n' scenario_plan='The scenario should define the configuration space, optimization limits (walltime, number of trials), and the number of workers. It will use the HyperparameterOptimizationFacade.' train_function_plan='The train function should take a configuration (hyperparameter settings) as input, train a model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) on the training data, and return the validation performance (e.g., 1 - accuracy). The data preprocessing and feature engineering steps should be performed within this function, before training the model. Class imbalance handling should also be implemented here.'
