An appropriate budget range would be min_budget=10 and max_budget=50, representing the number of training epochs. The number of workers (n_workers) should be set according to the available computational resources. Given the dataset's characteristics, a range of 4-8 workers could strike a good balance between parallelism and resource utilization.
