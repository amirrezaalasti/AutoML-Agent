[2025-06-17 20:07:10] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'Iris'}] dataset_name='Iris' dataset_tag='classification' recommended_configuration="For the Iris dataset, consider a configuration space with hyperparameters for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). For SVM, tune 'C' (regularization strength, e.g., 0.01 to 10) and 'kernel' (e.g., 'linear', 'rbf', 'poly'). If using 'rbf', tune 'gamma' (kernel coefficient, e.g., 'scale', 'auto', or a range like 0.001 to 1). For KNN, tune 'n_neighbors' (number of neighbors, e.g., 3 to 10) and 'weights' (e.g., 'uniform', 'distance'). Since the dataset is small, focus on exploring a wider range of hyperparameters rather than extensive fine-tuning on a single configuration. Given the dataset size, Bayesian Optimization with a Gaussian Process surrogate model is a reasonable starting point.  Also, consider setting a random_state for reproducibility." scenario_plan='Given the small size of the Iris dataset, multi-fidelity optimization is likely unnecessary. A standard Black-Box optimization facade (HPOFacade) is suitable. Set a walltime_limit (e.g., 60-120 seconds) and n_trials (e.g., 100-200) based on available computational resources.  One worker (n_workers=1) should suffice given the small dataset size and presumed fast evaluation time. Key scenario parameters include the configuration space, walltime_limit, and n_trials. The Iris dataset does not require instance-specific configurations.' train_function_plan="The train function should receive a configuration (hyperparameter settings) and a seed as input. Inside the train function, create an instance of the chosen model (e.g., SVM or KNN) using the provided configuration. Train the model on the entire Iris dataset. Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) and return the average validation accuracy as the target function value (SMAC minimizes, so return 1 - accuracy). Ensure that the seed is used for reproducibility (e.g., setting random_state in the model and cross-validation). The train function should handle potential exceptions and return a reasonable default value (e.g., 1.0) in case of failure."
