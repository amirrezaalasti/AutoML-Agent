For time series data, transformations like differencing or Box-Cox can help stabilize variance and make the series stationary. Ensure data is properly formatted for time series analysis, with a consistent time index.', 'Feature engineering for time series includes creating lagged variables, rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation), and time-based features (e.g., month, year). Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (ACF and PACF) can identify significant lags to use as predictors.', 'Challenges include dealing with non-stationarity, autocorrelation, and potential outliers. Careful model selection is important; ARIMA models, Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning models like LSTMs can be used. Appropriate evaluation metrics for time series forecasting (e.g., MAE, RMSE, MAPE) should be used.', 'When using RNN-based models, ensure the input data has the correct 3D shape (batch, sequence length, features). If the input is 2D and an RNN model is chosen, raise a ValueError. Use batch_first=True in all recurrent models.', 'Log time index or datetime values for analysis, but avoid direct use in models unless necessary.', 'Validate input data dimensions against model requirements, especially for sequential models. Raise errors if dimensions mismatch expected input shape, providing specific details (e.g., expected 3D tensor for LSTM).'] openml_url='https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&id=42148' recommended_configuration=''
