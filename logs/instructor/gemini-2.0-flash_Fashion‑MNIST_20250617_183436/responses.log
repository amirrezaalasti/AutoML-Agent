[2025-06-17 18:34:40] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'Fashionâ€‘MNIST'}] dataset_name='Fashion-MNIST' dataset_tag='image classification' recommended_configuration="The Fashion-MNIST dataset is suitable for applying deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A basic configuration involves normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1] and using a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Optimization can be performed using Adam or SGD. Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate and batch size, is crucial for achieving good performance. Given the dataset size, a smaller subset of the data may be used for initial experiments, with the full dataset used for final training. The dataset's inherent simplicity allows for relatively quick experimentation with different model architectures and hyperparameters." scenario_plan='The scenario involves hyperparameter optimization for a CNN model trained on Fashion-MNIST. Given the dataset size and complexity, a Multi-Fidelity optimization approach may be appropriate to allow for faster experimentation by training models on subsets of the data or for fewer epochs. The configuration space should include hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and number of filters in the convolutional layers. It is recommended to start with a Random initial design, and potentially switch to a Sobol design after some iterations. The optimization process can be limited by a walltime limit and a maximum number of trials. Early stopping mechanisms may improve the optimization process. Given that it is an image dataset, it could benefit from data augmentation and normalization.' train_function_plan='The train function should take a configuration (hyperparameter set) as input, along with a seed for reproducibility. Inside the train function, a CNN model should be instantiated with the given hyperparameters. The Fashion-MNIST dataset should be loaded and preprocessed (normalization). The model should be trained on the training set and evaluated on a validation set. The validation accuracy (or error rate) should be returned as the performance metric to be minimized. The function should handle potential exceptions (e.g., out-of-memory errors) gracefully.'
