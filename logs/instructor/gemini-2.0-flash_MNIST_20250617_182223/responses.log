[2025-06-17 18:22:36] [Metadata: {'dataset_name': 'MNIST'}] dataset_name='MNIST' dataset_tag='image classification' recommended_configuration='To effectively train models on the MNIST dataset, consider these configurations:\n\n1.  Data Preprocessing:\n    *   Input Format: For CNNs, reshape input to (N, 1, 28, 28) for PyTorch or (N, 28, 28, 1) for TensorFlow. For dense layers, flatten the input to (N, 784).\n    *   Normalization: Scale pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0.\n\n2.  Model Architecture:\n    *   CNN: A simple CNN with convolutional layers, ReLU activations, max pooling, and fully connected layers is a good starting point. The provided VGGNet configuration can serve as inspiration.\n    *   Dense Network: A multi-layer perceptron with ReLU activations can also be used, especially for baseline performance.\n\n3.  Training Parameters:\n    *   Batch Size: 128 is a commonly used batch size.\n    *   Epochs: Train for at least 10 epochs, but monitor validation loss to prevent overfitting.\n    *   Optimizer: Adam or SGD with momentum are suitable optimizers.\n    *   Learning Rate: Start with 0.001 and adjust as needed.\n\n4.  Regularization:\n    *   Dropout: Add dropout layers (e.g., rate of 0.5) to prevent overfitting.\n    *   Batch Normalization: Use batch normalization after convolutional layers.\n\n5.  SMAC Configuration:\n    *   Facade Type: MultiFidelityFacade is appropriate if considering varying training epochs or subsets of the data.\n    *   Budget Settings: Set min_budget to a small number of epochs (e.g., 5) and max_budget to the desired maximum number of epochs (e.g., 50).\n    *   Number of Workers: Set n_workers based on available CPU/GPU resources. Start with 4 and increase if possible.\n\n6.  SMAC Scenario Parameters:\n    *   walltime_limit: Set a reasonable time limit (e.g., 3600 seconds).\n    *   n_trials: Set the number of trials based on the budget and time constraints (e.g., 200).\n\nBest parameters to set in the Configuration Space:\n\n*   Learning Rate: UniformFloat(lower=1e-4, upper=1e-1, log=True, default_value=1e-3)\n*   Batch Size: Categorical([32, 64, 128, 256], default_value=128)\n*   Optimizer: Categorical(["Adam", "SGD"], default_value="Adam")\n*   Number of Convolutional Layers: Integer(lower=2, upper=5, default_value=3)\n*   Dropout Rate: UniformFloat(lower=0.0, upper=0.5, default_value=0.2)\n*   Number of Epochs: Integer(lower=10, upper=50, default_value=20)' scenario_plan='1.  Data Preprocessing:\n    *   Reshape input data to the appropriate format (N, 1, 28, 28) for CNNs or flatten to (N, 784) for dense layers.\n    *   Normalize pixel values by dividing by 255.0.\n\n2.  Model Definition:\n    *   Define a CNN or dense network using a configuration space. Allow SMAC to tune hyperparameters like the number of layers, filter sizes, and dropout rates.\n\n3.  SMAC Scenario Configuration:\n    *   Use MultiFidelityFacade for multi-fidelity optimization to potentially reduce optimization time.\n    *   Set min_budget and max_budget for the number of epochs.\n    *   Set n_workers based on available resources.\n    *   Set walltime_limit and n_trials to control the optimization process.\n\n4.  Special Considerations:\n    *   MNIST is a relatively simple dataset, so more complex models may not be necessary.\n    *   Ensure proper data loading and batching to avoid memory issues.\n    *   Monitor training and validation loss to prevent overfitting.' train_function_plan='1.  Define the Model:\n    *   The train function should take a configuration (hyperparameter settings) as input.\n    *   Based on the configuration, create the neural network model (CNN or dense network).\n\n2.  Data Loading and Preprocessing:\n    *   Load the MNIST dataset.\n    *   Apply the necessary preprocessing steps (reshaping, normalization).\n    *   Create data loaders for training and validation.\n\n3.  Training Loop:\n    *   Set up the optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD) with the learning rate from the configuration.\n    *   Iterate over the training data for a specified number of epochs (potentially controlled by the budget in multi-fidelity optimization).\n    *   Calculate the loss and update the model parameters.\n\n4.  Validation:\n    *   After each epoch (or at the end of training), evaluate the model on the validation set.\n    *   Calculate the validation accuracy or loss.\n\n5.  Return Value:\n    *   Return the validation loss (or 1 - validation accuracy) as the performance metric for SMAC to minimize.\n'
