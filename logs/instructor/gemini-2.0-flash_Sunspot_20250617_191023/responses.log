Scaling: Use MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to scale the data.\n2. Detrending: Remove any trend component using differencing or polynomial fitting.\n3. Seasonality Decomposition: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.\n\nFeature Engineering: 1. Lagged Features: Create lagged features (e.g., X(t-1), X(t-2), ...).\n2. Rolling Statistics: Calculate rolling mean, standard deviation, min, and max over a window.\n3. Exponential Smoothing: Apply exponential smoothing techniques to capture trends and seasonality.\n4. Fourier Transform: Use Fourier transform to extract frequency-domain features.\n\nCommon Challenges: 1. Non-stationarity: Time series data may be non-stationary, requiring transformations like differencing.\n2. Autocorrelation: Account for autocorrelation in the data when building models.\n3. Forecasting Horizon: The accuracy of forecasts decreases as the forecasting horizon increases.\n\nOpenML: Dataset name: Sunspots, Tags: timeseries' scenario_plan='Multi-fidelity optimization is not necessary for this relatively small dataset.
