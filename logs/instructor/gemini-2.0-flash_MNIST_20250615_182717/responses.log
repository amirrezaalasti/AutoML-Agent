'] openml_url='N/A' recommended_configuration='Based on the provided configurations, a VGG-like CNN architecture is effective. The model consists of convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max-pooling layers, batch normalization, and dense layers with dropout for regularization. The input shape is (28, 28, 1).  A batch size of 32 or 128 with 5 epochs has been shown to give good results.  Consider experimenting with different filter sizes, number of layers, and dropout rates to optimize performance.' scenario_plan="Given the relatively small size of the MNIST dataset and the relatively short training times, MultiFidelityFacade is not necessarily the most appropriate facade. MultiFidelityFacade shines when individual training runs are very long, which is not the case here.  Since we have configurations, AlgorithmConfigurationFacade can be used. The scenario should focus on efficiently exploring the configuration space of different CNN architectures and hyperparameters.  Here's a basic scenario:  1. **Facade:** AlgorithmConfigurationFacade  2. **Configuration Space:**  Use the layers specified in the configurations. Tune hyperparameters such as:    *   Learning rate (e.g., 1e-2 to 1e-5, log scale)    *   Batch size (e.g., 32, 64, 128)    *   Dropout rate (e.g., 0.25, 0.5)    *   Number of filters in convolutional layers (e.g., 32, 64, 128)    *   Kernel size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5)  3. **Budget:** Since training is fast, set a higher `n_trials` to allow for more exploration (e.g., 200-500 trials). `walltime_limit` should be set according to your available resources (e.g., 3600 seconds = 1 hour).  4. **Workers:** Set `n_workers` based on the number of CPU cores available (e.g., 4-8 workers).  5. **Initial Design:** Use a Sobol or Latin Hypercube initial design to efficiently cover the configuration space.  6. **Intensifier:** Use the default intensifier.  7. **Surrogate Model:** Use Random Forest as the surrogate model.  8. **Acquisition Function:** Use Log Expected Improvement as the acquisition function.  9. **Callbacks:** Implement callbacks for logging and visualization of the optimization process.
