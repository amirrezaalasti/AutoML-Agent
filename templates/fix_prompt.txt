The following Python code is intended to define a function named `get_configspace()` that returns a valid `ConfigSpace.ConfigurationSpace` object for classification model tuning. However, the code has produced the following error(s) during execution:

{errors}

Your task is to fix the issues in the code. The requirements below MUST be respected:

1. Do not change the function name or its purpose — it must define and return a `ConfigurationSpace` with appropriate hyperparameters.
2. Fix all syntax and runtime errors.
3. Use only valid parameters for ConfigSpace objects (e.g., use `default_value=...` instead of `default=...`).
4. Do not change the logic unless necessary for fixing errors.
5. Return ONLY the corrected function code — no explanations, comments, or extra output.
6. The function must be syntactically and semantically correct, and executable with `exec`.
