**Fix the following Python code that has encountered errors during execution.**

---

### ** CRITICAL ERROR HANDLING RULE:**
**ABSOLUTELY NO try/except BLOCKS ALLOWED!**
* **Why**: Try/except blocks hide real errors and make debugging impossible
* **Instead**: Use proper validation, type checking, and explicit error handling
* **If errors occur**: Let them propagate naturally so they can be identified and fixed
* **This is a HARD REQUIREMENT**: Any code with try/except will be rejected

---

### ** CRITICAL GENERALIZATION RULE:**
**ELIMINATE ALL HARDCODED DIMENSIONS!**
* **Why**: The original code likely failed because it made incorrect assumptions about the data's shape.
* **Action**: Replace all hardcoded numbers related to data dimensions with values derived dynamically from the inputs (e.g., `X.shape[1]`, `y.nunique()`).

---

### **Error Information:**
{errors}

---

### **Code to Fix:**
{code}

---

### **Fix Requirements:**

* **Function Preservation:**
  * Maintain the original function name and signature
  * Preserve the function's core purpose and behavior
  * Keep the return type and value format

* **Error Resolution (NO try/except):**
  * Fix all syntax errors
  * Resolve runtime errors
  * Handle edge cases with conditional logic
  * Validate inputs explicitly
  * Use proper type checking and validation
  * Let errors propagate naturally for debugging

* **Code Quality:**
  * Maintain code readability
  * Follow Python best practices
  * Use proper type hints
  * Add necessary imports
  * Ensure proper documentation

* **Best Practices (NO try/except):**
  * Use explicit validation instead of exception handling
  * Implement proper input validation with conditional checks
  * Handle edge cases with if/else statements
  * Ensure code is maintainable and debuggable
  * Follow framework conventions
  * Let errors surface naturally for proper debugging

---

### **Output Format:**

* Return **only** the fixed function code
* Include necessary imports
* No explanations or comments
* The code must be executable
* **NO try/except blocks allowed**

---

### **Example Structure (NO try/except):**

```python
def fixed_function():
    # Validate inputs explicitly
    if not valid_input:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input: reason")
    
    # Handle edge cases with conditional logic
    if edge_case_condition:
        return default_value
    
    # Fixed code here
    return result
```

---

** FINAL REMINDER - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
* Valid `import` statements
* The fixed function code
* No additional code or explanations
* ** ABSOLUTELY NO try/except BLOCKS - USE EXPLICIT VALIDATION INSTEAD**
* ** IF ERRORS OCCUR, LET THEM PROPAGATE NATURALLY FOR DEBUGGING**
* ** DO NOT CHEAT BY HIDING ERRORS WITH EXCEPTION HANDLING**
