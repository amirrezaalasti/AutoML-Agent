**Objective: Analyze, diagnose, and fix the provided Python code based on the execution errors. Your primary goal is to identify the root cause of the error and implement a robust, logical solution.**

### **Error Information:**
{errors}

---

### **Code to Fix:**
{code}

---

### **Phase 1: Debugging and Root Cause Analysis (Your Thought Process)**
Before writing any code, you must first think through the problem. Formulate a hypothesis for the root cause of the errors. Consider the following:

1.  **Data Mismatch:** Is there a discrepancy between the data type the function *expects* (e.g., `dataset: pd.DataFrame`) and the data type it's likely receiving (e.g., `dataset: Dict[str, Any]`)? What is the most common data format passed between SMAC components?
2.  **Configuration Key Mismatch:** If `cfg.get('some_key')` returns `None`, what is the most likely cause? Is it a typo in the key name? Is the `get_configspace` function defining different keys than the `train` function is using?
3.  **Invalid Operations:** Why did the operation fail? (e.g., `int(None)` fails because you cannot cast `None` to an integer).

### **Phase 2: Fixing Strategy (Your Plan)**
Based on your analysis in Phase 1, briefly outline your plan to fix the code.

* **Example Strategy:** "My analysis suggests the `dataset` parameter is a dictionary, not a DataFrame as type-hinted. The `cfg` is also missing keys. My strategy is to:
    1.  Correct the function signature to accept `dataset: Dict[str, Any]`.
    2.  Extract `X` and `y` from the `dataset` dictionary at the beginning of the function.
    3.  Use the safe `cfg.get('key', default_value)` method to retrieve all hyperparameters, providing sensible defaults to prevent `NoneType` errors.
    4.  Ensure all hyperparameters are cast to their correct types (e.g., `int()`) *after* retrieving them with a default."

### **Phase 3: Corrected Code Implementation**
Now, provide the complete, fixed Python code.

* **CRITICAL RULES:**
    * **NO `try/except` BLOCKS.** Use explicit validation (e.g., `if value is None: ...`) to handle potential issues. Let errors that indicate a fundamental problem (e.g., a required key is missing and has no default) propagate naturally.
    * **NO HARDCODED DIMENSIONS.** All shapes and sizes must be inferred dynamically from the input data.
    * **ONLY OUTPUT THE FINAL, EXECUTABLE CODE.** Include all necessary imports. Do not include the analysis or strategy from Phases 1 and 2 in the final code output.
