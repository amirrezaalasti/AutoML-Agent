The following python code is generated by an LLM which now has run into the following errors:
{errors}

Your task is to fix the issues in the code. The requirements below MUST be respected:

1. Do not change the function name or its purpose.
2. Fix all syntax and runtime errors.
3. Use only valid parameters.
4. Do not change the logic unless necessary for fixing errors.
5. Return ONLY the corrected function code â€” no explanations, comments, or extra output.
6. The function must be syntactically and semantically correct, and executable with `exec`.

Buggy code:
{code}
