**Generate a production-grade Python scenario configuration for SMAC hyperparameter optimization with the following STRICT requirements:**

---

### **Function signature** must be:

```python
from smac import Scenario
from ConfigSpace import ConfigurationSpace
def generate_scenario(cs: ConfigurationSpace) -> Scenario:
```

---

### **Scenario Configuration Requirements:**

* The scenario **must** be optimized for the dataset characteristics:
  * Dataset Description: `{dataset_description}`

* The scenario **must** include:
  * Appropriate budget settings (min_budget, max_budget)
  * Optimal number of workers for parallelization
  * Reasonable walltime and CPU time limits
  * Proper trial resource constraints
  * Appropriate number of trials

* **Best Practices:**
  * Set deterministic=False for better generalization
  * Use multi-fidelity optimization when appropriate
  * Configure proper output directory structure
  * Set appropriate trial resource limits
  * Enable parallel optimization when possible

* **Resource Management:**
  * Set appropriate memory limits for trials
  * Configure proper walltime limits
  * Enable parallel processing when beneficial
  * Consider dataset size for budget settings

---

### **Available Parameters:**
    configspace : ConfigurationSpace
        The configuration space from which to sample the configurations.
    name : str | None, defaults to None
        The name of the run. If no name is passed, SMAC generates a hash from the meta data.
        Specify this argument to identify your run easily.
    output_directory : Path, defaults to Path("smac3_output")
        The directory in which to save the output. The files are saved in `./output_directory/name/seed`.
    deterministic : bool, defaults to False
        If deterministic is set to true, only one seed is passed to the target function.
        Otherwise, multiple seeds (if n_seeds of the intensifier is greater than 1) are passed
        to the target function to ensure generalization.
    objectives : str | list[str] | None, defaults to "cost"
        The objective(s) to optimize. This argument is required for multi-objective optimization.
    crash_cost : float | list[float], defaults to np.inf
        Defines the cost for a failed trial. In case of multi-objective, each objective can be associated with
        a different cost.
    termination_cost_threshold : float | list[float], defaults to np.inf
        Defines a cost threshold when the optimization should stop. In case of multi-objective, each objective *must* be
        associated with a cost. The optimization stops when all objectives crossed the threshold.
    walltime_limit : float, defaults to np.inf
        The maximum time in seconds that SMAC is allowed to run.
    cputime_limit : float, defaults to np.inf
        The maximum CPU time in seconds that SMAC is allowed to run.
    trial_walltime_limit : float | None, defaults to None
        The maximum time in seconds that a trial is allowed to run. If not specified,
        no constraints are enforced. Otherwise, the process will be spawned by pynisher.
    trial_memory_limit : int | None, defaults to None
        The maximum memory in MB that a trial is allowed to use. If not specified,
        no constraints are enforced. Otherwise, the process will be spawned by pynisher.
    n_trials : int, defaults to 100
        The maximum number of trials (combination of configuration, seed, budget, and instance, depending on the task)
        to run.
    use_default_config: bool, defaults to False.
        If True, the configspace's default configuration is evaluated in the initial design.
        For historic benchmark reasons, this is False by default.
        Notice, that this will result in n_configs + 1 for the initial design. Respecting n_trials,
        this will result in one fewer evaluated configuration in the optimization.
    instances : list[str] | None, defaults to None
        Names of the instances to use. If None, no instances are used.
        Instances could be dataset names, seeds, subsets, etc.
    instance_features : dict[str, list[float]] | None, defaults to None
        Instances can be associated with features. For example, meta data of the dataset (mean, var, ...) can be
        incorporated which are then further used to expand the training data of the surrogate model.
    min_budget : float | int | None, defaults to None
        The minimum budget (epochs, subset size, number of instances, ...) that is used for the optimization.
        Use this argument if you use multi-fidelity or instance optimization.
    max_budget : float | int | None, defaults to None
        The maximum budget (epochs, subset size, number of instances, ...) that is used for the optimization.
        Use this argument if you use multi-fidelity or instance optimization.
    seed : int, defaults to 0
        The seed is used to make results reproducible. If seed is -1, SMAC will generate a random seed.
    n_workers : int, defaults to 1
        The number of workers to use for parallelization. If `n_workers` is greather than 1, SMAC will use
        Dask to parallelize the optimization.

--- 

### **Output Format:**

* Return **only** the `generate_scenario(cs)` function
* Include necessary imports
* No example usage or additional code
* The function must be self-contained and executable

---

### **Error Prevention:**

* Ensure all parameters are within valid ranges
* Verify that resource limits are reasonable
* Check that budget settings are appropriate
* Validate that parallelization settings are correct
* Ensure the training function can be pickled for parallel processing

---

### **Example Structure:**

```python
def generate_scenario(cs: ConfigurationSpace) -> Scenario:
    scenario = Scenario(
        configspace=cs,
        name="HyperparameterOptimization",
        output_directory="{output_directory}" //this is important and should not be changed
        deterministic=True,
        //other parameters based on the information
    )
    return scenario
```

---

### **Suggested Scenario Plan:**

{scenario_plan}

---

**Reminder:** The output must be limited to:
* Valid `import` statements
* A single `generate_scenario(cs)` function that returns a properly configured `Scenario` object
* No additional code or explanations
* The output_directory should be "{output_directory}"
* Set the number of trials to 10 for sufficient exploration
* set the number of workers to 1
* do not set these parameters: walltime_limit, cputime_limit, trial_walltime_limit ,trial_memory_limit=
