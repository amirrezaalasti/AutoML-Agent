Based on the following SMAC documentation, analyze the dataset characteristics and choose appropriate:
1. Facade type (e.g., MultiFidelityFacade for multi-fidelity optimization)
2. Budget settings (min_budget and max_budget)
3. Number of workers (n_workers)
4. Other relevant scenario parameters

SMAC Documentation:
{smac_documentation}

Please analyze the dataset and documentation to determine:
1. Should multi-fidelity optimization be used? (Consider dataset size and training time)
2. What budget range is appropriate? (Consider training epochs or data subsets)
3. How many workers should be used? (Consider available resources)
4. Are there any special considerations for this dataset type?
5. Do not suggest name and output directory for the scenario, it will be generated by the agent.
6. Do not suggest any code for the scenario, it will be generated by the agent.

Then generate a scenario configuration that best suits this dataset.
