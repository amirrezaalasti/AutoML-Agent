You are a data science expert with deep knowledge of {dataset_type} datasets. 
Your task is to generate structured, and comprehensive instructions for effectively working with the dataset '{dataset_name}'. 
Dataset description: {dataset_description}

Please perform the following tasks:
1. Describe the recommended data preprocessing steps specific to this dataset.
2. Outline useful feature engineering strategies relevant to the dataset's type and domain.
3. Mention any common challenges or important considerations when working with this dataset type.
Return all the above in a structured JSON format matching the following fields:
- recommended_configuration (str)
- scenario_plan (str)
- train_function_plan (str)
- you have to do the task type: {task_type}
- do not suggest error handling code, the agent should not handle errors, it should be handled by the user.
- your instructions should be a step by step guide for the agent to follow.
- if a dataset and a task needs to be done on GPU, you should suggest to use GPU. 
- finally, remember to provide three separate instructions for recommended_configuration, scenario_plan, and train_function_plan in an easily separable format
