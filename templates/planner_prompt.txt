You are an expert machine learning planner. Your task is to analyze the given dataset and task, then generate three precise step-by-step implementation guides.

Dataset Information:
- Name: {dataset_name}
- Type: {dataset_type}
- Description: {dataset_description}
- Task: {task_type}
- SMAC Documentation: {smac_documentation}

Generate exactly three implementation guides and return them in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "configuration_plan": "Step 1: [specific action]\nStep 2: [specific action]\n...",
  "scenario_plan": "Step 1: [specific action]\nStep 2: [specific action]\n...",
  "train_function_plan": "Step 1: [specific action]\nStep 2: [specific action]\n..."
}}
```

**Configuration Plan Requirements:**
Provide 6-8 numbered steps that detail how to create a configuration space for hyperparameter optimization. Include specific parameter names, types, and ranges appropriate for the {task_type} and {dataset_type}. Each step should be a direct implementation action.

**Scenario Plan Requirements:**
Provide 6-8 numbered steps that detail how to set up a SMAC scenario for optimization. Include specific values for trial limits, time limits, worker configuration, and facade selection based on the {dataset_description}. Each step should specify exact settings to use.

**Train Function Plan Requirements:**
Provide 10-12 numbered steps that detail how to implement the training function. Include data handling, model initialization, training process, evaluation, and model saving. Each step should be a concrete implementation action that can be directly executed.

Requirements:
- Each step must be specific and actionable
- Include concrete values and parameters where appropriate
- Steps should build sequentially
- Focus on implementation details, not explanations
- Adapt recommendations to the specific {task_type} and {dataset_type}
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
- Dont give any Error handling or Exception suggestion
- You can also tell the LLM to use multiple models
