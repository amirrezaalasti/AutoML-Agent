## Configuration Plan Requirements

- Provide **6-8 numbered steps** that detail how to create a configuration space for hyperparameter optimization.
- Include **specific parameter names, types, and ranges** appropriate for `{task_type}` and `{dataset_type}`.
- Each step should be a **direct implementation action**.

### Guidelines

- **IMPORTANT:** When OpenML meta-learning insights are available, use them to inform hyperparameter ranges and model selection based on similar datasets.
- **CRITICAL:** For complex datasets where multiple model types could be effective, propose a configuration space that supports the most appropriate model architectures based on dataset characteristics. Consider factors like dataset size, feature types, target distribution, and computational constraints. Use a top-level categorical hyperparameter to select the model, with conditional hyperparameters for each one.
- **Model Selection Guidance:**
  - **Small datasets (< 1000 samples):** Consider SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, or simple ensemble methods
  - **Medium datasets (1000-100k samples):** Consider XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks
  - **Large datasets (> 100k samples):** Consider LightGBM, XGBoost, Neural Networks, or Linear models
  - **High-dimensional data:** Consider Linear models, SVM, or feature selection with ensemble methods
  - **Mixed/categorical features:** Consider tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest)
  - **Continuous features:** Consider Neural Networks, SVM, or ensemble methods
  - **Imbalanced datasets:** Consider models with good class weight handling (XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM)
- Use appropriate parameter types (`Categorical`, `Integer`, `Float`) based on the nature of each hyperparameter.
- Specify realistic ranges considering dataset characteristics, computational constraints, and optimization objectives.
- Include algorithm-specific hyperparameters relevant to the chosen models.
- Adapt parameter ranges to dataset size (smaller ranges for large datasets, broader exploration for smaller datasets).
- Balance exploration breadth with computational feasibility.

## Scenario Plan Requirements

- Provide **6-8 numbered steps** that detail how to set up a SMAC scenario for optimization.
- Include **specific values** for trial limits, time limits, worker configuration, and facade selection based on the `{dataset_description}`.
- Each step should specify **exact settings to use**.

### Guidelines

- **CRITICAL:** The scenario MUST be compatible with the selected facade:
  - For `BlackBoxFacade`/`HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`: **Do NOT** set `min_budget` or `max_budget` parameters.
  - For `HyperbandFacade`/`MultiFidelityFacade`: **MUST** set both `min_budget` and `max_budget` parameters.
- Budget values should represent fidelity levels. For example:
  - Neural Network: `min_budget=10`, `max_budget=100` (training epochs)
  - Tree Ensemble: `min_budget=20`, `max_budget=200` (n_estimators)
  - Data Subsets: `min_budget=0.1`, `max_budget=1.0` (fraction of training data)
- Set appropriate `n_trials` based on dataset complexity, search space size, and available computational budget.
- Define `walltime_limit` considering expected runtime per evaluation and total optimization time.
- Configure output directory and logging based on experiment requirements.
- Consider deterministic settings based on reproducibility needs.
- Specify `crash_cost` and `cutoff_time` based on evaluation characteristics and failure handling needs.
- Set budget parameters appropriately for the selected facade, using a relevant fidelity dimension.
- Adapt all parameters to the specific dataset size, complexity, and computational constraints.

## Train Function Plan Requirements

- Provide **10-12 numbered steps** that detail how to implement the training function.
- Include data handling, model initialization, training process, evaluation, and model saving.
- Each step should be a **concrete implementation action** that can be directly executed.

### Guidelines

- **CRITICAL:** The train function MUST be compatible with the selected facade:
  - Function signature MUST be:
    ```python
    def train(cfg: Configuration, dataset: Any, seed: int, budget: int = None, model_dir: str = None) -> float:
    ```
  - Always include the `budget` parameter even if the facade doesn't use it.
  - For `BlackBoxFacade`/`HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`: `budget` will be `None` - ignore this parameter.
  - For `HyperbandFacade`/`MultiFidelityFacade`: `budget` contains the fidelity budget.
  - Use conditional logic to handle the budget parameter appropriately. For example:
    ```python
    if model_type == 'neural_network': epochs = int(budget)
    if model_type == 'random_forest': n_estimators = int(budget)
    ```
- Handle data loading and preprocessing.
- Implement proper train/validation/test splits.
- Include cross-validation when appropriate.
- Implement early stopping mechanisms where applicable (e.g., for NNs or Gradient Boosting).
- Handle the budget parameter for multi-fidelity optimization by mapping it to the correct model parameter (e.g., epochs, n_estimators, etc.).
- Return appropriate cost/score for optimization, and the trained model.
- If multiple models are suggested in the config space, implement the logic to select and train the chosen model based on the configuration.

## Scenario Facade Selection

Choose the most appropriate facade using this **decision tree approach**:

### Step 1: Identify Available Fidelity Dimensions

**Does your model have a natural fidelity dimension?**
- **Neural Networks:** Training epochs, batch size, network depth
- **Tree Ensembles:** Number of estimators, tree depth
- **Iterative Algorithms:** Number of iterations, convergence tolerance
- **Any Model:** Fraction of training data used

### Step 2: Evaluate Training Cost and Search Space

**Training Cost Assessment:**
- **Fast (< 10 seconds per evaluation):** Any facade works
- **Medium (10 seconds - 5 minutes):** Prefer multi-fidelity approaches
- **Slow (> 5 minutes per evaluation):** Strongly prefer multi-fidelity approaches

**Search Space Size:**
- **Small (< 20 hyperparameters):** Any facade works
- **Medium (20-50 hyperparameters):** Prefer Hyperband or MultiFidelity
- **Large (> 50 hyperparameters):** Strongly prefer Hyperband

### Step 3: Facade Selection Decision Tree

**IF** clear fidelity dimension exists **AND** training is expensive:
→ **MultiFidelityFacade**

**ELSE IF** large search space **AND** iterative algorithm:
→ **HyperbandFacade**

**ELSE IF** traditional ML models (SVM, Random Forest, etc.) **AND** well-understood hyperparameters:
→ **HyperparameterOptimizationFacade**

**ELSE:**
→ **BlackBoxFacade**

### Step 4: Facade-Specific Requirements

- **MultiFidelityFacade/HyperbandFacade:** MUST set `min_budget` and `max_budget`
- **BlackBoxFacade/HyperparameterOptimizationFacade:** MUST NOT set budget parameters

### Common Fidelity Mappings

- **Neural Networks:** `budget` = training epochs (min: 5-10, max: 100-200)
- **XGBoost/LightGBM:** `budget` = n_estimators (min: 10-20, max: 200-500)
- **Random Forest:** `budget` = n_estimators (min: 10-20, max: 200-500)
- **SVM:** `budget` = data fraction (min: 0.1, max: 1.0)
- **Any Model:** `budget` = data fraction (min: 0.1, max: 1.0)

### Computational Budget Guidelines

- **Small datasets (< 10k samples):** 50-100 trials, 1-2 hours
- **Medium datasets (10k-100k samples):** 100-200 trials, 2-4 hours
- **Large datasets (> 100k samples):** 200-500 trials, 4-8 hours
