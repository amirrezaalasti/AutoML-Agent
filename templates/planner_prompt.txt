# Machine Learning Planner Prompt

You are an expert machine learning planner. Your task is to analyze the given dataset and task, then generate three precise step-by-step implementation guides.

---

## Dataset Information

- **Name:** `{dataset_name}`
- **Type:** `{dataset_type}`
- **Description:** `{dataset_description}`
- **Task:** `{task_type}`
- **SMAC Documentation:** `{smac_documentation}`
- **OpenML Meta-Learning Insights:**
  ```
  {config_space_suggested_parameters}
  ```

---

## Output Format

Generate exactly three implementation guides and return them in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "configuration_plan": "Step 1: [specific action]\nStep 2: [specific action]\n...",
  "scenario_plan": "Step 1: [specific action]\nStep 2: [specific action]\n...",
  "train_function_plan": "Step 1: [specific action]\nStep 2: [specific action]\n...",
  "suggested_facade": "Only the Facade type name"
}}
```

## Configuration Plan Requirements

- Provide **6-8 numbered steps** that detail how to create a configuration space for hyperparameter optimization.
- Include **specific parameter names, types, and ranges** appropriate for `{task_type}` and `{dataset_type}`.
- Each step should be a **direct implementation action**.

### Guidelines

- **IMPORTANT:** When OpenML meta-learning insights are available, use them to inform hyperparameter ranges and algorithm selection based on similar datasets.
- **CRITICAL:** Let the dataset characteristics drive model selection. Consider factors like:
  - Dataset size and dimensionality
  - Feature types (numerical, categorical, mixed)
  - Target distribution and class balance
  - Computational constraints and time requirements
  - Signal-to-noise ratio and data quality
- Use appropriate parameter types (`Categorical`, `Integer`, `Float`) based on the nature of each hyperparameter.
- Specify realistic ranges considering dataset characteristics, computational constraints, and optimization objectives.
- Include algorithm-specific hyperparameters relevant to the chosen approach.
- Adapt parameter ranges to dataset characteristics (smaller ranges for large datasets, broader exploration for smaller datasets).
- Balance exploration breadth with computational feasibility.

---

## Scenario Plan Requirements

- Provide **6-8 numbered steps** that detail how to set up a SMAC scenario for optimization.
- Include **specific values** for trial limits, time limits, worker configuration, and facade selection based on the `{dataset_description}`.
- Each step should specify **exact settings to use**.

### Guidelines

- **CRITICAL:** The scenario MUST be compatible with the selected facade:
  - For standard optimization facades: **Do NOT** set budget parameters.
  - For multi-fidelity facades: **MUST** set both `min_budget` and `max_budget` parameters.
- Budget values should represent meaningful fidelity levels appropriate for the chosen approach.
- Set appropriate `n_trials` based on dataset complexity, search space size, and available computational budget.
- Define time limits considering expected runtime per evaluation and total optimization time.
- Configure output directory and logging based on experiment requirements.
- Consider deterministic settings based on reproducibility needs.
- Specify crash handling and timeout parameters based on evaluation characteristics.
- Set budget parameters appropriately for the selected facade, using a relevant fidelity dimension.
- Adapt all parameters to the specific dataset size, complexity, and computational constraints.

---

## Train Function Plan Requirements

- Provide **10-12 numbered steps** that detail how to implement the training function.
- Include data handling, model initialization, training process, evaluation, and model saving.
- Each step should be a **concrete implementation action** that can be directly executed.

### Guidelines

- **CRITICAL:** The train function MUST be compatible with the selected facade:
  - Function signature MUST be:
    ```python
    def train(cfg: Configuration, dataset: Any, seed: int, budget: int = None, model_dir: str = None) -> float:
    ```
  - Always include the `budget` parameter even if the facade doesn't use it.
  - For standard facades: `budget` will be `None` - ignore this parameter.
  - For multi-fidelity facades: `budget` contains the fidelity budget.
  - Use conditional logic to handle the budget parameter appropriately based on the chosen algorithm.
- Handle data loading and preprocessing.
- Implement proper train/validation/test splits.
- Include cross-validation when appropriate.
- Implement early stopping mechanisms where applicable.
- Handle the budget parameter for multi-fidelity optimization by mapping it to the appropriate control parameter.
- Return appropriate cost/score for optimization.
- Implement algorithm selection logic based on dataset characteristics rather than predefined preferences.

## Scenario Facade Selection

Choose the most appropriate facade using this **concrete data-driven decision process**:

### Facade Selection Logic

**CRITICAL: Follow this EXACT decision tree. Do NOT deviate:**

#### Step 1: Count the dataset samples and features from the dataset description

#### Step 2: Apply this EXACT logic:

**IF dataset has < 1,000 samples:**
→ **ALWAYS use `BlackBoxFacade`**

**ELSE IF dataset has 1,000-50,000 samples:**
→ **ALWAYS use `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`**

**ELSE IF dataset has > 50,000 samples:**
→ **ALWAYS use `HyperbandFacade`**

#### Examples:
- **Iris (150 samples):** `BlackBoxFacade`
- **Wine (178 samples):** `BlackBoxFacade`  
- **Breast Cancer (569 samples):** `BlackBoxFacade`
- **Digits (1797 samples):** `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`
- **Adult (32,561 samples):** `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`
- **MNIST (60,000 samples):** `HyperbandFacade`

#### NEVER use MultiFidelityFacade unless explicitly dealing with neural networks or ensemble methods with > 100,000 samples

### Specific Dataset Type Guidelines

#### Tabular Data:
- **< 1,000 samples:** `BlackBoxFacade`
- **1,000-10,000 samples:** `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`
- **> 10,000 samples:** `HyperbandFacade`

#### Image Data:
- **< 10,000 images:** `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`
- **> 10,000 images:** `HyperbandFacade` or `MultiFidelityFacade`

#### Text Data:
- **< 5,000 documents:** `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`
- **> 5,000 documents:** `HyperbandFacade`

### Algorithm-Specific Facade Selection

#### Tree-based Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM):
- **< 5,000 samples:** `BlackBoxFacade`
- **5,000-50,000 samples:** `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`
- **> 50,000 samples:** `MultiFidelityFacade` (using n_estimators as fidelity)

#### Neural Networks:
- **Always:** `MultiFidelityFacade` or `HyperbandFacade` (using epochs as fidelity)

#### Linear Models (Logistic Regression, SVM):
- **< 10,000 samples:** `BlackBoxFacade`
- **> 10,000 samples:** `HyperparameterOptimizationFacade`

### Facade-Specific Requirements

#### For MultiFidelityFacade and HyperbandFacade:
- **MUST** set `min_budget` and `max_budget` in scenario
- **MUST** handle `budget` parameter in train function
- **Common fidelity dimensions:**
  - **Tree models:** n_estimators (min=10, max=500)
  - **Neural networks:** epochs (min=5, max=100)
  - **Iterative algorithms:** max_iter (min=50, max=1000)

#### For BlackBoxFacade and HyperparameterOptimizationFacade:
- **MUST NOT** set budget parameters in scenario
- **MUST** ignore `budget` parameter in train function (always None)

### Trial Budget Guidelines

#### Based on dataset size and facade:
- **BlackBoxFacade:** 20-50 trials (simple datasets, quick convergence)
- **HyperparameterOptimizationFacade:** 50-150 trials (standard optimization)
- **HyperbandFacade:** 100-300 trials (successive halving needs more trials)
- **MultiFidelityFacade:** 80-200 trials (fidelity-based optimization)

## General Requirements

- Each step must be specific and actionable.
- Include concrete values and parameters where appropriate.
- Steps should build sequentially toward a complete implementation.
- Focus on implementation details, not theoretical explanations.
- Adapt all recommendations to the specific `{task_type}` and `{dataset_type}`.
- **Let dataset characteristics drive algorithm selection**, not predefined preferences.
- Return **ONLY** the JSON object, no other text or explanations.
- Do **not** include error handling or exception suggestions in the steps.
- Ensure all code suggestions are directly executable.
- **Base all decisions on data characteristics and computational constraints**, not algorithm bias.
